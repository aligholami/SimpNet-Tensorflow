### Introduction

This repository contains the first unofficial implementation of SimpNet architecture described in the paper "
Towards Principled Design of Deep Convolutional Networks: Introducing SimpNet" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06205).


### MNIST Performance

Here is the **loss** and **accuracy** results after running the model on the MNIST dataset. Results shown here are provided after 18 epochs of training.
